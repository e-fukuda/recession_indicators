# Abstract
Recreate the paper, describe. Extend analysis through current year. Summarize findings. 

# Data
Our data source is ____. Description of variables. Give relevant definitions, context, etc.

# Methodology
Describe models. Include table from office hours. 
Note results from using two different coarseness levels for time variable (quarterly and yearly). Highlight that this is another contribution from us. 
Note addition of indicator var for zero dividend. Highlight that this is a design choice on our part, and that it differs from the paper.

$$ln(price_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1ln(dividends_{it}) + \beta_2\mathbb{I}(dividends = 0) + \beta_3ln(bookvalue_{it}) + \beta_4ln(cashflow_{it}) + \mu_{i} + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}$$

# Findings
Which model is most significant? Did we replicate what the paper reported? What did we learn from our extension of the model to more recent data? 

# Plots
Reproduce the plots in the paper. Note differences and extend to new years. Explore new plots, see if we can come up with anything more descriptive.
