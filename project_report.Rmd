# Abstract
Recreate the paper, describe. Extend analysis through current year. Summarize findings. 

# Data
Our data source is ____. Description of variables. Give relevant definitions, context, etc.

# Methodology
Describe models. Include table from office hours. 
Note addition of indicator var for zero dividend. Highlight that this is a design choice on our part, and that it differs from the paper.

$$ln(price_{it}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1ln(dividends_{it}) + \beta_2\mathbb{I}(dividends = 0) + \beta_3ln(bookvalue_{it}) + \beta_4ln(cashflow_{it}) + \mu_{i} + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}$$

# Findings
Which model is most significant? Did we replicate what the paper reported? What did we learn from our extension of the model to more recent data? 

# Plots
Reproduce the plots in the paper. Note differences and extend to new years. Explore new plots, see if we can come up with anything more descriptive.
